## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to uncover patterns in loan approvals across income brackets, property areas, and credit histories.  
The pipeline follows a complete **ETL + Analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI.  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **ETL Pipeline**
   - **Extracted** raw loan application dataset (600+ records).  
   - **Transformed** data using Python (Pandas/NumPy): handled missing values, feature engineering (total income, loan-to-income ratio, income brackets).  
   - **Loaded** cleaned dataset into MySQL for structured querying.  

2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Queried loan approval rates across income brackets, property areas, and credit histories.  
   - Generated KPIs like average loan amount and loan-to-income ratio.  

3. **Excel Reporting**
   - Built pivot tables for loan status by education, credit history, and property area.  
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight borrower risk segments.  

4. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Designed interactive dashboard with:
     - **KPI Cards**: Approval Rate, Average Loan Amount, Average Total Income  
     - **Bar Charts**: Loan approvals by Property Area, Education  
     - **Heatmap (Matrix)**: Credit History × Property Area with Approval Rate  
     - **Histogram**: Loan amount distribution  
     - **Gauge Chart**: Approval rate vs target benchmark  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Approval rates are **highest among applicants with positive credit history**.  
- **Semi-Urban applicants** have higher approval likelihood compared to Urban/Rural.  
- **Higher income brackets** correlate with larger approved loan amounts.
